# Stroke Functional Outcome Prediction (Ordinal ML)

XGBoost-based dual-head pipeline for ordinal prediction of post-stroke functional outcome (e.g. mRS), alongside stroke subtype classification.

## Key Features
- Ordinal classification framework for functional outcome prediction
- Dual-head modeling:
  - Stroke subtype (ischemic vs hemorrhagic)
  - Ordinal mRS outcome
- Handles class imbalance
- Stratified cross-validation
- Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn

## Data
Clinical and imaging-derived features from an acute stroke cohort (ICPSR).

## Purpose
Academic research in computational neurology (MS-level research project)
